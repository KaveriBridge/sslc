* Formerly there was a king named Dharmadwaja in Ujjain. He had three queens namely Indulekha, Taravalee and Mrigankavati. Once, while the king was playing with the queens at the spring festival, the elder queen Indulekhe had a flower on her ear and slipped and fell on her thigh, injuring her. When she fainted, the king treated her with cold therapy. Taravali, the second queen, was bathed in the rays of the moon and moaned. The king treated her, made her a bed of lotus flowers and laid her down. Meanwhile, the third queen, Mrigankavati, heard the sound of threshing grain as the night came on the deserted road, and sat down on the road, clapping her hands with sores on her face. The king treated her with cold treatments.

* Tell me who among these three queens is more gentle? Betala asked.

* Then King Vikrama was the younger queen who was more tender. Because she was injured just by hearing the voice of Musala. But for the rest of the queens, Utpala needed the touch of moonbeams. He replied that the reason is that these two are not equal to her.

* At that very moment Betala escaped from the king and joined Spasnana.
