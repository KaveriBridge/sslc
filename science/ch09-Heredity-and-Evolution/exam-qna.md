### Explain the two methods to estimate the age of fossils.
* Ans. :
* Relative method — If we dig into the earth, the fossils we find closer to the earth’s surface are more recent than the fossils we find in deeper layers. 
* Dating method - By detecting the ratios of different isotopes of the same element in the fossil material.
### Mendel crossed plants bearing red flowers ( RR ) with the plants bearing white flowers ( rr ) and produced progeny from them. The plants with red flowers obtained in F1 generation were different from the plants with red flowers of parental generation. Why ? Explain with reasons.
* Ans
* In parent generation, plant bearing red flowers has both the dominant traits RR. In parent generation, plant bearing white flowers has both the recessive traits rr.
* F1 generation plant inherits one copy of dominant trait ( red ) and one copy of recessive trait ( white ) from the parental plants Rr. But only the dominant trait ( red ) is expressed.

### The gene for brown coloured hair is recessive that of gene for black coloured hair. What is the hair colour of a person who has inherited a gene for brown coloured hair from mother and black coloured hair from father ?
* Ans. : Black coloured hair 

### What is evolution ? Explain the three evidences for evolution
* Ans
* Phenomenon of gradual change of organisms from simple form into complex form in a long period is called evolution
* Three evidences are :
  * i) Homologous organs : The organs which have same basic structures but modified to perform different functions are called homologous organs. Provide the information that organisms of different species might be evolved from common ancestor. 
  * ii) Analogous organs : The organs which have different basic structures but they perform similar function are called analogous organs. Provide the information that though the organs of different organisms perform same function they may not have same function but they may not be evolved from common ancestor. 
  * iii) Fossils : The dead remains of past organisms under the rocks/deep earthen layers are called fossils. They help to study evidence and missing link between different species. They help to understand the sequence of evolution and help in classification of organisms.

### The plant bearing round yellow coloured ( RrYy ) seed are self pollinated with the same plant. Represent the result obtained in the F2 generation of dihybrid cross with the help of a checker board. Mention the varieties of plants obtained in F2 generation.
* Answer

|Gametes| RY| Ry| rY| ry|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|RY |RRYY| RRYy| RrYY| RrYy|
|Ry |RRYy| RRyy| RrYy| Rryy|
|rY |RrYY| RrYy| rrYY| rrYy|
|ry |RrYy| Rryy| rrYy| rryy|

* The plants obtained are 
* Round yellow — 9
* Round green — 3
* Wrinkled yellow — 3
* Wrinkled green — 1
