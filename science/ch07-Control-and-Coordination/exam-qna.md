#### (Q) Name the given structure. 
* Reflex arc
#### (Q) What is its general function? 
* It gives sudden action in response to the event happening in the environment.
#### (Q) Mention the function of the parts labelled as A and B. 
* Sensory neuron : It conducts the impulse of stimulus from receptor to the spinal cord. 
* Effectors : Which shows the sudden visible response
#### (Q) These structures in animals are said to be efficient ways to give quick responses. Why?
* Reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking process of brain is not fast enough in many animals. 
* Many animals have very little of the complex neuron network needed for thinking.
* So it can function in the absence of true thought process and increase the chance of survival.
