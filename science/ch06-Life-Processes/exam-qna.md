## (Q) What is photosynthesis? 
* The process in which green plants prepare food by using carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll is called photosynthesis.
## (Q) Which is the organic product released during photosynthesis? Write the function of this product.
* Carbohydrates / Glucose
* Carbohydrates are utilized for providing energy to the plants
## (Q) Draw the diagram showing the schematic sectional view of the human heart. 
* Label the following parts :
* i) Aorta
* ii) Pulmonary veins.

## (Q) “The body temperature of frogs and lizards depend on temperature in the environment.” Justify
* Both frogs and lizards have three chambered heart 
* Oxygenated and deoxygenated blood mix in the heart.
* Production of energy became slightly less. This energy cannot be used for maintaining constant temperature.

## (Q) “The rate of breathing in aquatic organisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms.” Why ?
* Because, the amount of dissolved oxygen is fairly low compared to the amount of oxygen in the air.
